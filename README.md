# Assignment

This app was created using flutter framework which integrated a dummy api, a music player and a form.

## What I did.

All 4 questions have been attempted. Following are the key points of the assignment: 

State managment - Used Bloc Package for state management

API - https://dummyjson.com/products. Fetched products, displayed a clean UI. Also did some calculations such as discounted price. Also added Cart functionality, add more items, etc.

Validation - Inside the form page, Email checks for proper format. Password should be of 6 or more characters. Phone number should be exactly of length 10. Rest of the fields should be non empty to make the submit button visible.

OOP concepts - Used objects as instances of classes.

DRY concepts - Used Dynamic widget builders to avoid repetitive code.

Use of assets file - Music player plays audio with file source from assets.
